# 🤖 AI Tools Used

* This project leveraged AI-powered development tools to accelerate building the website:

* GitHub Copilot: Helped in writing React components, managing state, and reducing repetitive boilerplate code — especially in pages like contactud.jsx and apidocs.jsx.

* v0.dev: Used to generate the Hero section, the Pricing table UI and Team members card view. This saved me about 3 hours of manual design and implementation.

* Tailwind CSS IntelliSense: For rapid styling and autocomplete in CSS classes.

* Using these AI tools helped focus on UX and responsiveness while quickly scaffolding components. 


# 📝 Notes & Decisions

* The website is built with React (using functional components and hooks).

* Tailwind CSS is used for styling and responsive design.

* Navbar is fully responsive with desktop and mobile support, including a hamburger menu and animated transitions.

* The About Us page fetches real data from the JSONPlaceholder API to display team member profiles dynamically.

* The sidebar navigation in the API Documentation page is responsive with mobile toggling.

* All pages are fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

* Form validation and submission in the Contact page are minimal (no backend integration yet).

* Git is used for version control with meaningful commit messages.
