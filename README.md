/public - Static assets like images and favicon


#ü§ñ AI Tools Used

This project leveraged AI-powered development tools to accelerate building the website:

GitHub Copilot: Assisted with writing React components, state management, and API integration, speeding up coding and reducing boilerplate.

v0.dev: Generated initial UI components from text prompts, especially for the Hero section and Pricing cards, which saved about 2 hours.

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense: For rapid styling and autocomplete in CSS classes.

Using these AI tools helped focus on UX and responsiveness while quickly scaffolding components.


#üìù Notes & Decisions

The website is built with React (using functional components and hooks).

Tailwind CSS is used for styling and responsive design.

The About Us page fetches real data from the JSONPlaceholder API to display team member profiles dynamically.

The sidebar navigation in the API Documentation page is responsive with mobile toggling.

All pages are fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

Form validation and submission in the Contact page are minimal (no backend integration yet).

Git is used for version control with meaningful commit messages.
